# Lab IA Knowledge Book

## Overview

This Knowledge Book project is focused on facilitating the sharing of knowledge between Etalab's data scientists and other technical roles using data formats and tools that make sense in these professions. It allows us to publish posts  (Markdown and Jupyter Notebook) to better promote the analysis of our work.

Inspired by airbnb's [Knowledge Repo](https://github.com/airbnb/knowledge-repo) and using the amazing [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/) project to generate static content.
